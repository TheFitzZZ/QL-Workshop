    "description" "Race factories for QLRace.com servers, includes turbo(PQL) and classic(VQL) modes.
I have added a MG to all factories so you can use it to open doors. All factories have low respawn delay(10 ms)

qlrace_turbo: Turbo physics with RL, PG and MG.
qlrace_turbo_strafe: Turbo physics with MG only and finite ammo.

qlrace_classic: Classic physcis with RL, PG and MG.
qlrace_classic_strafe: Classic physics with MG only and finite ammo.
